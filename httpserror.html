<div id="https"><h1>Support of HTTPS</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, this website does not support HTTPS.</p>

<p>While we do support and encourage the use of secure communication protocols, we technically cannot due to the design of our website.</p>

<p>Our website uses the Open Weather Map API in order to display the weather. We are not currently paying to use that API and therefore we are restricted to the free features of that API. <a href="https://openweathermap.desk.com/customer/portal/questions/8166727-http-to-https">The support of HTTPS by the Open Weather Map API is a paying feature.</a></p>

<p>When you are loading the website with an HTTPS protocol, your browser will block any non-secure call, including HTTP, which is why our website won't work.</p>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience.</p></div>
